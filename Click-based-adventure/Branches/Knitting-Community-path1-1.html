<h1> You decide to join in on the fun
    </h1>
    <span> <p>They might have attacked you if you didn't join them. It was a good choice to join them. You don't enjoy being part of this but its necessary to survive at this point. They are soaking the yarn in blood to add color and make it better. The person in the middle had their life slowly sucked from them. But the leaders want more, they are running out of supplies. They ask you to get more funds. Do you wish to give money from your pocket or just ignore all their requests ? </p> </span>
