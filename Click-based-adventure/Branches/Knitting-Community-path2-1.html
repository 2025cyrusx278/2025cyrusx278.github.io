<h1> You decided to go sleep
    </h1>
    <span> <p> After working on your glove for a bit you have decided to go to sleep. You were very tired because this was your first day at the camp. The moment you were laying down, you had passed out. Suddenly you were in your own house and eating breakfast with your family. Your family decided to go to a theme park to celebrate your birthday. It was an amazing day, you ate lots of food, played games, and bonded with your family. You heard people calling for you but you decided to ignore it. You learned it was all just a fake dream when you were woken up by a scream. It was already noon by the time you woke up. It was dark outside. You had forgotten about the club meeting. Do you want to go the club area to talk to your leaders or just leave the club?</p> </span>
