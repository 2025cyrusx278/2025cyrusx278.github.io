<h1> Go towards the group
    </h1>
    <span> <p> You decide to follow the path and go towards the group huddled around a campfire. As you slowly approach the group, you start to hear some muffled screams. Its not just a campfire they are huddled around, there is a human in the center. You notice some red substance on the grass but its hard to see because its dark outside. It smells like .. blood. They are using alchemy to create things and the main ingredient is <strong>BLOOD.</strong> They notice you coming towards you. Do you want to try to run or join in on the fun? </p> </span>
