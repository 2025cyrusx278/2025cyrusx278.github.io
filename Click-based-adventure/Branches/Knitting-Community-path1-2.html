<h1> You decide to run 
    </h1>
    <span> <p>After seeing all the dark things that have happened, you decide to run away from the camp. You find yourself lost in the forest. You hear some people chanting something in the forest. They seem to be doing similar things to the group of people you originally ran away from. Do you choose to approach them? Or do you want to keep running?</p> </span>
